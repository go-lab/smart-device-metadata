Go-Lab Smart Device Metadata Specification - Draft
==================================================

**Status:** Draft

This repository contains the specification of the metadata format for the Go-Lab Smart Device. The
aim of the metadata specification is to declare the services a Smart device provides and the data
needed to communicate with external services. The specification is making use of [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#512-resource-object)
to define the smart device APIs.
